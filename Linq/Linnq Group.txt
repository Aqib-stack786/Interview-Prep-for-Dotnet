*IEnumerable Enumerable, IQueryable Queryable
IEnumerator vs IEnumerable
An IEnumerator is a thing that can enumerate: it has the Current property and the MoveNext and Reset methods (which in . NET code you probably won't call explicitly, though you could). An IEnumerable is a thing that can be enumerated...which simply means that it has a GetEnumerator method that returns an IEnumerator .
Lazy: don't do the work until you absolutely have to.
Deferred: means don't compute the result until the caller actually uses it.
select vs select many
--
Select-> selecting values from a collection.
// Two foreach loops are required to iterate through the results
// because the query returns a collection of arrays.

SelectMany-> selecting values from a collection of collection i.e. nested collection.
// Only one foreach loop is required to iterate through the results 
// since query returns a one-dimensional collection.
